# FIF_C
C implementation of the Fast Iterative Filtering

### Dependencies ###

GNU C/C++ compiler
FFTW 3 library

The code has been written in C, but using some of the C++ standards, therefore it must be compiled using a c++ compiler

The code has been tested with the standard gcc and fftw3 library installed on ubuntu20.04

### Install ###
Simply compile by typing ``` make ```

Run by typing ``` ./test ```

plot results with ```python3 ./testfifc.py```  (requires numpy and pylab). You should obtain an image like this one

### Contacts ###
The C version of the FIF algorithm has been written by Igor Bertello - INAF (igor.bertello@inaf.it) and Emanuele Papini - INAF (emanuele.papini@inaf.it).

The original code and algorithm conceptualization are authored by Antonio Cicone - University of L'Aquila (antonio.cicone@univaq.it).

Please feel free to contact us would you need any help in getting FIF up and running.
